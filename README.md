## Description:

This is a laptop warehouse website. This is a stock management system. Here you can add a new product. Update the existing product quantity. Users can show which product he/she uploaded. And also can delete products. In this project, I use react js for client-side and express js for server-side and MongoDb for database, and firebase for authentication.
